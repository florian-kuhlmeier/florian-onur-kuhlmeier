Hi! Welcome to my personal site.

I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Ulm and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. My research is on how to design conversational agents to tackle symptoms of depression. 

I enjoy statistics and data visualization, personal knowledge management and I'm a supporter of open science. Over time, I'll try to blog about the things I learn and do in these areas and my research.
