Hi!

I am a first year PhD Candidate at the University of Ulm and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. My research is on how to design, develop and evaluate conversational agents to treat symptoms of depression. Besides, I am interested in statistical and computational approaches, data visualization, and passionate about open science.
